# LayoutLMv3 Pretraining and Inference

This project implements the LayoutLMv3 model for document understanding tasks, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference capabilities.

## Overview

LayoutLMv3 is a powerful multimodal model that combines textual, visual, and layout information for document understanding tasks. This implementation provides tools for pretraining the model on custom datasets, fine-tuning for specific tasks, and performing inference on pretrained models.

## Features

- Data preparation for LayoutLMv3 pretraining
- Model implementation of LayoutLMv3
- Pretraining script for custom datasets
- Fine-tuning script for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks
- Inference script for pretrained models
- Configurable training and model parameters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7 or higher
- Transformers library
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/layoutlmv3-pretraining.git
   cd layoutlmv3-pretraining
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset according to the [data preparation guide](docs/PreTraining.md#preparing-the-data-for-pretraining)

4. Configure your model and training parameters in `config/config.yaml`

### Usage

#### Pretraining

To start pretraining the model:

```
python main.py --config config/config.yaml
```

#### Inference

To run inference using a pretrained model:

```
python tests/test_model_inference.py
```

Follow the prompts to input the necessary information.
